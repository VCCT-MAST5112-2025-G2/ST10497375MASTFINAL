## Christoffel's kitchen

I was approached by Christoffel, a renowned chef, to create a mobile app that allows him to present his menu for customers to see. Each food is put in it's own course group, such as main course, dessert, drinks, etc. 

The app allows him to add as many items as he pleases. For user accessibility, the menu is displayed on the home page, with the option of deleting the item by pressing on "remove". 

To make things more organized, there is a page that filters all the foods into their categories.
